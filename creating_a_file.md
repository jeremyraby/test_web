# How to create a new file
## Types of files that can be created
Only plaintext and Markdown (`.md`) files can be created. It will default to plaintext if you don't specify a filetype in the filename above.

## Preview
You can use the `Preview` button to the top-left of this text box to see how it will be rendered after being committed. If you want it to look pretty and somewhat formatted as an HTML page, you have to use Markdown formatting and ensure the file is saved as `.md`. 

## Indents and line length
Coders and programming languages have very specific and strong opinions on how indents should be handled - with spaces or tabs - and how many characters should display on a single line (typically 80 characters). You can change these settings at the top-right of this text box. The indent option is first and will either display `Spaces` or `Tabs` in the dropdown, then in the middle dropdown you can choose the number of spaces to use for autoindents (Python, for example, specifies that indents should be 4 spaces and you can either manually hit the space bar 4 times or set your tabs to be 4 spaces and just hit that key once). The indents option defaults to 2 spaces and you'll see the effect whenever you hit the enter key after a line. The line wrapping dropdown is farthest on the right and defaults to `No wrap.` `Soft wrap` will obviously wrap the line so you don't have to scroll forever.

## Keyword Highlights
Some words are automatically highlighted/displayed in different colors. These are programming keywords and don't mean anything, but you should probably be aware it will happen and won't affect you other than possibly be annoying. It will be different depending on if you're using plaintext or Markdown.
