# What's the big deal
Version control allows you to see every change that's been made to a file since it was first uploaded, so long as major changes have been saved or "committed." Not only can you see who made those changes (helpful if working with multiple people), but you can revert to an older version if need be. "Need be" could be you made a change and don't like it anymore, **or** your computer dies and you need to download the latest version that's been saved lol

## How to view older versions
The most direct way that **I** know how to do this is to open the file page then click the `Blame` button toward the top-left. This will show every commit that's been made, when it was made and who made it. If you click on the commit message it will take you to another page that shows what the change was (will have a green background).

## Getting Older Versions
What I'm not 100% sure on is how to actually get older versions of files. I've not had to do this, so I've only read about it a few times a long time ago. **But** [this 1:15 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l48bjGUcqXQ) shows how to do it fairly quickly.

## Branching and merging
Think of the TVA and Loki - the "main branch" is the Sacred Timeline and "branches" are alternate timelines which can either be pruned or "merged" with the "main branch." Making branches/"pull requests"/"merging" isn't something I've done, but I can see how it would be helpful for you as a designer as you can make multiple simultaneous edits to a carousel post and then decide which you want to keep (for example). Google how to do this (or check the repo I linked on the README) if you decide you want to try.
