12 Common Regression Mistakes: The mandatory warning label,The accepted convention is to reject a null hypothesis when we observe something that would happen by chance only 1 in 20 times or less if the null hypothesis were true,
12 Common Regression Mistakes: The mandatory warning label,"For example, one should not design a research strategy built around the following premise: Since we don’t know what causes autism, we should put as many potential explanatory variables as possible in the regression equation just to see what might turn up as statistically significant; then maybe we’ll get some answers. If you put enough junk variables in a regression equation, one of them is bound to meet the threshold for statistical significance just by chance",

11 Regression Analysis: The miracle elixir,"When we include multiple variables in the regression equation, the analysis gives us an estimate of the linear association between each explanatory variable and the dependent variable while holding other dependent variables constant, or “controlling for” these other factors",
11 Regression Analysis: The miracle elixir,One rough rule of thumb is that the coefficient is likely to be statistically significant when the coefficient is at least twice the size of the standard error,
11 Regression Analysis: The miracle elixir,effect is not likely to be a product of chance—but that effect may be so small as to be trivial or socially insignificant,"An $80 increase in annual income for people with blonde hair could be statically significant with a low probability to be explained by chance, but that's not enough of change to warrant dying your hair or investigating for discrimination. This is where domain knowledge and judgement come into play."

The sign (positive or negative) on the coefficient for an independent variable tells us the direction of its association with the dependent variable (the outcome we are trying to explain,Negative means an inverse relationship and shown with a downward sloping line from left to right. Positive is the exact opposite.
11 Regression Analysis: The miracle elixir,"For any regression coefficient, you will generally be interested in three things: sign, size, and significance.","y= a + bx; where y is the dependent var,  a is the y-intercept, b is the slope of the line, and x is the dependent var
The result of this equation is known as the regression coefficient and quantifies how much y changes given every 1 unit change in x, eg for every 1 unit increase in x, there's a 4.5 unit change in y"
11 Regression Analysis: The miracle elixir,"If you were asked to describe the pattern, you might say something along the lines of “Weight seems to increase with height.” This is not a terribly insightful or specific statement. Regression analysis enables us to go one step further and “fit a line” that best describes a linear relationship between the two variables",
11 Regression Analysis: The miracle elixir,"At its core, regression analysis seeks to find the “best fit” for a linear relationship between two variables. A simple example is the relationship between height and weight. People who are taller tend to weigh more—though that is obviously not always the case",
11 Regression Analysis: The miracle elixir,"If 10,000 people who exercise three or more times a week have sharply lower rates of cardiovascular disease than 10,000 people who don’t exercise (but are similar in all other important respects), then the chances are pretty good that we will see a similar association between exercise and cardiovascular health for the broader population",A regression analysis is *not* definitive proof; it allows us to accept or reject the null hypothesis and quantify the level of probability the null hypothesis is correct/incorrect
11 Regression Analysis: The miracle elixir,"Personal computing has made the mechanics of regression analysis almost effortless. The problem is that the mechanics of regression analysis are not the hard part; the hard part is determining which variables ought to be considered in the analysis and how that can best be done. Regression analysis is like one of those fancy power tools. It is relatively easy to use, but hard to use well—and potentially dangerous when used improperly.",
11 Regression Analysis: The miracle elixir,"Regression analysis is the statistical tool that helps us deal with this challenge. Specifically, regression analysis allows us to quantify the relationship between a particular variable and an outcome that we care about while controlling for other factors","Hold other variables constant while allowing only one variable to be manipulated. For instance, a study comparing rates of heart disease among workers would want only the job categories to change and all other variables, eg exercise habits, preexisting health conditions, etc, to be similar for each individual within the sample"
Appendix to Chapter 10,One of the most basic statistical principles is that a proper sample will look like the population from which it is drawn. The real challenge of polling is twofold: finding and reaching that proper sample; and eliciting information from that representative group in a way that accurately reflects what its members believe.,

10 Polling: How we know that 64 percent of Americans support the death penalty (with a sampling error ± 3 percent),"Pollsters can test for “nonresponse bias” by analyzing available data on the respondents whom they were not able to contact. Do they live in a particular area? Are they refusing to answer for a particular reason? Are they more likely to be from a particular racial, ethnic, or income group? This kind of analysis can determine whether or not a low response rate will affect the results of the poll.",
10 Polling: How we know that 64 percent of Americans support the death penalty (with a sampling error ± 3 percent),One indicator of a poll’s validity is the response rate: What proportion of respondents who were chosen to be contacted ultimately completed the poll or survey,

9 Inference: Why my statistics professor thought I might have cheated,"If we require five eyewitnesses in order to convict every criminal defendant, then a lot of guilty defendants are wrongly going to be set free. (Of course, fewer innocents will go to prison.) If we adopt a .001 significance level in the clinical trials for all new cancer drugs, then we will indeed minimize the approval of ineffective drugs. (There is only a 1 in 1,000 chance of wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis that the drug is no more effective than a placebo.) Yet now we introduce the risk of not approving many effective drugs because we have set the bar for approval so high. This is known as a Type II error, or false negative",

9 Inference: Why my statistics professor thought I might have cheated,"One of the first questions you want to ask is, How big is this effect? It could easily be .9 points; on a test with a mean score of 500, that is not a life-changing figure",
9 Inference: Why my statistics professor thought I might have cheated,I should also point out that statistical significance says nothing about the size of the association,"Just because there's a 20% reduction (or increase) doesn't necessarily matter - what the original chance was 0.005, would a 20% reduction or increase actually matter?"
9 Inference: Why my statistics professor thought I might have cheated,This threshold should be established by the researchers before they do their statistical analysis to avoid choosing a threshold after the fact that is convenient for making the results look significant,
9 Inference: Why my statistics professor thought I might have cheated,"If the .05 significance level seems somewhat arbitrary, that’s because it is. There is no single standardized statistical threshold for rejecting a null hypothesis. Both .01 and .1 are also reasonably common thresholds for doing the kind of analysis described above",

2 Descriptive Statistics: Who was the best baseball player of all time?,"Any index is highly sensitive to the descriptive statistics that are cobbled together to build it, and to the weight given to each of those components. As a result, indices range from useful but imperfect tools to complete charades",
2 Descriptive Statistics: Who was the best baseball player of all time?,"Alas, the disadvantage of any index is that it consolidates lots of complex information into a single number. There are countless ways to do that; each has the potential to produce a different outcome",

2 Descriptive Statistics: Who was the best baseball player of all time?,Percentage change must not be confused with a change in percentage points,
2 Descriptive Statistics: Who was the best baseball player of all time?,"The point is that a percentage change always gives the value of some figure relative to something else. Therefore, we had better understand what that something else is.",
2 Descriptive Statistics: Who was the best baseball player of all time?,The formula for calculating a percentage difference (or change) is the following: (new figure – original figure)/original figure. The numerator (the part on the top of the fraction) gives us the size of the change in absolute terms; the denominator (the bottom of the fraction) is what puts this change in context by comparing it with our starting point,
2 Descriptive Statistics: Who was the best baseball player of all time?,Percentages are useful—but also potentially confusing or even deceptive,
2 Descriptive Statistics: Who was the best baseball player of all time?,"The easiest way to give meaning to these relative comparisons is by using percentages. It would mean something if I told you that Granola Bar A has 50 percent more sodium than Granola Bar B, or that Uncle Al’s income fell 47 percent last year. Measuring change as a percentage gives us some sense of scale.",
2 Descriptive Statistics: Who was the best baseball player of all time?,"But suppose that I told you that Granola Cereal A contains 31 milligrams more sodium than Granola Cereal B. Unless you know an awful lot about sodium (and the serving sizes for granola cereal), that statement is not going to be particularly informative",
2 Descriptive Statistics: Who was the best baseball player of all time?,Descriptive statistics are often used to compare two figures or quantities. I’m one inch taller than my brother; today’s temperature is nine degrees above the historical average for this date; and so on.

The weights of the airline passengers are “more spread out,” which is an important attribute when it comes to describing the weights of these two groups. The standard deviation is the descriptive statistic that allows us to assign a single number to this dispersion around the mean",
2 Descriptive Statistics: Who was the best baseball player of all time?,"On the basis of the descriptive tools introduced so far, the weights of the airline passengers and the marathoners are nearly identical. But they’re not. Yes, the weights of the two groups have roughly the same “middle,” but the airline passengers have far more dispersion around that midpoint, meaning that their weights are spread farther from the midpoint. My eight-year-old son might point out that the marathon runners look like they all weigh the same amount, while the airline passengers have some tiny",

If he’s in the 8th percentile, then he’s really struggling. In this case, the percentile (the relative score) is more meaningful than the number of correct answers (the absolute score).",
2 Descriptive Statistics: Who was the best baseball player of all time?,"If I place ninth in the golf tournament, that is a relative statistic. A “relative” value or figure has meaning only in comparison to something else, or in some broader context, such as compared with the eight golfers who shot better than I did",

1 What’s the Point?,"Even in the best of circumstances, statistical analysis rarely unveils “the truth.” We are usually building a circumstantial case based on imperfect data. As a result, there are numerous reasons that intellectually honest individuals may disagree about statistical results or their implications",
1 What’s the Point?,"researchers will gather detailed information on thousands of people, including how frequently they eat bran muffins, and then use regression analysis to do two crucial things: (1) quantify the association observed between eating bran muffins and contracting colon cancer (e.g., a hypothetical finding that people who eat bran muffins have a 9 percent lower incidence of colon cancer, controlling for other factors that may affect the incidence of the disease); and (2) quantify the likelihood that the association between bran muffins and a lower rate of colon cancer observed in this study is merely a coincidence—a quirk in the data for this sample of people—rather than a meaningful insight about the relationship between diet and health.",

Yes, that is both the strength and the weakness of any descriptive statistic","Summarizing events into a simple number, then comparing two such events across time may be an accurate representation if the events but it's far from precise.
