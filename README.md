Testing how to do all this stuff on the web interface

## Why does this exist?
Just ensuring I know how to do everything using the web interface instead of using the command line so I can show Jess how to do it as a non-coder.

### Different file types
I also plan to upload various filetypes to see how the process of saving them works and how they display here and how they can then be downloaded/pulled.

## Further help
[This](https://github.com/tvanantwerp/github-for-non-programmers/blob/master/SUMMARY.md) is a pretty basic and helpful repo on using GitHub Desktop on Windows. Probably still relevant if you want to use the desktop app instead of doing things on the web. Also has good info about using Git and GitHub more generally.
