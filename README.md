Testing how to do all this stuff on the web interface

## Why does this exist?
Just ensuring I know how to do everything using the web interface instead of using the command line so I can show Jess how to do it as a non-coder.

### Different file types
I also plan to upload various filetypes to see how the process of saving them works and how they display here and how they can then be downloaded/pulled.
