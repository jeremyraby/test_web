# How to create a new file
You can click the `+` button toward the top-right of the list of files (left of the green `<> Code` button) to create or upload a new file. Multiple files can be uploaded at a time, but you only get 1 commit message about each one - choose wisely lol

## Committing (Saving)
When you've created a new file, to save it you have to click the green `Commit changes...` button in the top-right. You'll then be given the opportunity to either leave "commit message" as the default or make one yourself. These are short sentences that describe the changes you made and will display next to the file name when on the main page of the repo. You can also write longer descriptions in the text box below the commit message. Making a commit message descriptive will help you understand what changes you made and identify the specific changes you want to view when looking for older versions of files. Click the green `Commit changes...` button in the bottom-right when you've finished writing your commit message.

### Committing when uploading files
You have the same options as above, it just looks a little different

## Types of files that can be created
Only plaintext and Markdown (`.md`) files can be created. It will default to plaintext if you don't specify a filetype in the filename above.

## Preview
You can use the `Preview` button to the top-left of this text box to see how it will be rendered after being committed. If you want it to look pretty and somewhat formatted as an HTML page, you have to use Markdown formatting and ensure the file is saved as `.md`. 

## Indents and line length
Coders and programming languages have very specific and strong opinions on how indents should be handled - with spaces or tabs - and how many characters should display on a single line (typically 80 characters). You can change these settings at the top-right of this text box. The indent option is first and will either display `Spaces` or `Tabs` in the dropdown, then in the middle dropdown you can choose the number of spaces to use for autoindents (Python, for example, specifies that indents should be 4 spaces and you can either manually hit the space bar 4 times or set your tabs to be 4 spaces and just hit that key once). The indents option defaults to 2 spaces and you'll see the effect whenever you hit the enter key after a line. The line wrapping dropdown is farthest on the right and defaults to `No wrap.` `Soft wrap` will obviously wrap the line so you don't have to scroll forever.

## Keyword Highlights
Some words are automatically highlighted/displayed in different colors. These are programming keywords and don't mean anything, but you should probably be aware it will happen and won't affect you other than possibly be annoying. It will be different depending on if you're using plaintext or Markdown.
