# Downloading files
Any file can be downloaded by clicking the button next to the pencil. It looks like most download icons, kind of like an upside down staple with a down arrow above it.

## "Raw"
Some filetypes, eg `.docx` & `.xlsx`, may not display on here and will automatically be downloaded if you click "view raw" (will display instead of the text/file you're attempting to view. It's a little annoying, but how it goes lol. Images seem to display without needing to be downloaded, and `.csv` files will display in Preview mode or can be viewed as `code`. Clicking the `Raw` button near the `Download` button will also download the file.
