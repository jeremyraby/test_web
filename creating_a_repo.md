# Creating a new repo[sitory]
1. From your "Your Repositories" page, click the green `New` button
2. Name it
3. Decide if it will be public or private.
- You can change this later and only public repos can be viewed by other people
4. Check the box "Add a README file"
- This allows you to write an overview of what the repo is for and is really helpful for you as well as anyone who may view it later
